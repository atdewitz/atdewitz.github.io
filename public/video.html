        <p>So I got towed this morning...</p>

        <p>
          I was so preoccupied with work and phone calls that I forgot to move
          my car after the snow emergency was declared.
        </p>

        <p>Everything happens for a reason.</p>

        <p>
          That time was spent reflecting, talking, joking. (That money was spent
          elsewhere...)
        </p>

        <p>
          But sometimes we do need an event like this to help us to re-center
          ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>It could be worse, it could be better. It is what it is.</p>

        <p>Ignore the negative thoughts. Make the next move. Learn from it.</p>

        <p>Balance is what keeps us from falling off the tightrope of life.</p>

        <p>
          Things like work-life balance and our health habits are fundamental in
          this.
        </p>

        <p>The creation to consumption ratio is also a fun one :)</p>

        <p>Try to put out into the world as much as you consume.</p>

        <p>
          Use a journal or **note cards** to write down valuable bits of
          information from entertainment, books or podcasts. That way you can
          organize and sort it out easier.

          I heard this awhile back at a MVRS event, put on by Dan Nelson + team,
          from Jim Kelly...
        </p>

        <p>
          80% of any team are followers&mdash;they show up on time, put in the
          hours and get their work done.
        </p>

        <p>
          20% are leaders and high performers&mdash;they put in the extra hours
          and contribute more than is asked of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter if you're working at a company or on your own projects, take
          the steps to make sure you put 100% in everything you do.
        </p>

        <p>
          That could mean things like helping or communicating on company chat
          rooms/bulletin boards more, implementing new ideas or networking with
          new people in the business.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm so proud to see the people I've grown up with and met throughout
          the years achieving so much.

          Personally, I love to start hundreds of different projects all at the
          same time. The energy is flowing and I feel the motivation to get
          everything done at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          This can be great, but it can also become a poor habit as you start to
          notice your incomplete projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Create a checklist of things you need to do. Set priorities and tackle
          one at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This has dramatically increased my productivity as I no longer try to
          switch from task to task every hour. Plus, it feels great to finish
          something entirely.
        </p>

        <p>Complete, move on, feel great.</p>

        <p>
          A great logo shows exactly what your business offers just by looking
          at it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use colors in logos to invoke emotions. Some examples: &mdash;Red for
          hunger, urgency or excitement &mdash;Green for healthy, organic
          products or the environment &mdash;Black for power, intelligence or
          simplicity
        </p>

        <p>
          Make it special and make it a part of you. This is YOUR brand and
          others will recognize you from it.
        </p>

        <p>
          One easy way to create a logo, if you're not too artistically
          inclined, is to use a free online AI logo maker. Create a design using
          the software to get some ideas, and then take it to a graphic designer
          to have it perfected.

          The email has a checklist on all the important things to do on a low
          level to get a good night sleep, but also includes what to do on a
          HIGHER LEVEL: &mdash;Why do you want to sleep more? &mdash;Who are you
          capable of being when you&rsquo;re well-rested? &mdash;What are you
          capable of accomplishing?
        </p>

        <p>
          These were the questions I started asking myself that pushed me to
          make these changes in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was the immediate implementation I was searching for to tell
          myself late at night, &quot;I can work on this task tomorrow.&quot;

          Getting our beautiful content in front of someone's face is getting
          harder by the day. Emails are still one of the greatest tools into the
          lives of prospective leads.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cold emailing can work, but how about getting a lead to engage with
          you AND hand deliver their email address?
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, it takes more than a simple text input on a website to
          capture a lead's email address.
        </p>

        <p>
          People are looking for value in exchange for a key to their personal
          inbox, or as I like to call it, their home.
        </p>

        <p>
          You need to offer something in return, such as: <br />&mdash;Free
          e-books or tips<br />&mdash;Free trials or products
          <br />&mdash;Coupon codes <br />&mdash;Newsletters/podcasts
        </p>

        <p>Try to get creative with it.</p>

          I am halfway through my 28 Days of Video Challenge on LinkedIn and
          here is my experience...
        </p>

        <p>
          What I learned: &mdash; Talking in front of a camera gets A LOT easier
          &mdash; How to edit videos on Premiere, FCP, iMovie, etc. &mdash;
          LinkedIn is a very strong platform
        </p>

        <p>
          What challenged me: &mdash; Balancing my time &mdash; Coming up with
          new content &mdash; Posting every single day
        </p>

        <p>
          I appreciate all the support I've received along the way. I wouldn't
          be able to do it without you.

        <p>When you keep up with the work, you will see growth.</p>

        <p>
          I look up to a lot of these individuals on LinkedIn who are always
          pushing out new content. Love seeing more people hopping on the train
          as well.

          a video with me.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this clip, I asked him what some of his successful habits or daily
          routines were. You can see the full video at the link below.
